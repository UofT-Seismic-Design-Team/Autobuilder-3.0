Tower Variation
================

The **Tower Variation** code is used to generate a dictionary of tower variations. It accomplishes this by creating all possible combinations of variables associated with bracing groups, section groups, and area section groups. These combinations are then applied to panels and members, resulting in different tower variations. In the following pages, you will find detailed explanations of the code's different functions and their parameters.
